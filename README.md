# BraveTheBugs
I created a small game for fun for the 2019 Community Game Jam. It came 104th overall out of 1050 entries and 49th in the innovation category

It can be seen on https://dominikalk.itch.io/brave-the-bugs

It is a game in which a game designer and programmer try to make a game but the programmer accidentally leaves some bugs ;)

Controls - Use "Arrow" keys to move, Use "Space" to jump, and the "Arrow keys and Enter" to navigate the user interface. Use "Q" to pause and "M" to mute audio.
